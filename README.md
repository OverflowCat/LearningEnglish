# LearningEnglishFetch.py
A piece of Python script to help you fetch the titles of the answers to the Newspaper *Learning English* that offered in its website. It may require a QR code in the following issue to scan to get 'em otherwise.

The codes are in a Jupyter notebook for convenience on debugging. Go to Google Colab to [check it](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Y-ZnT_W0rZqW8tAyEUc4_BewHxCJwCH3) online.

It requires Requests-HTML. You need to install it first.

```shell
$ pip3 install requests-html
```

 Since I enter Grade 12 and this year the newspaper seems unwilling to provide a QR code, I DO NOT USE IT NOW.
